## Caesarea Philippi: Why the Location of Peter's Confession Matters

When Jesus asks *"Who do you say I am?"* in Matthew 16, he asks it at a very specific location: **Caesarea Philippi**, in the far north of Israel near the base of Mount Hermon.

This was not a neutral setting.

Caesarea Philippi was a center of pagan worship, most notably associated with the Greek god Pan. At the base of a large rock cliff there was a cave and a spring — the Greeks called it the **Gates of Hades**, believing it to be a literal entrance to the underworld. The surrounding area was filled with temples and shrines, including one built to honor the Roman emperor Augustus Caesar. It was, in every sense, a place saturated with competing religious claims and pagan spiritual presence.

This is where Jesus chose to ask the question, receive Peter's confession, and make the declaration: *"On this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it."*

This was almost certainly not coincidental. Jesus was standing in front of a landmark literally called the Gates of Hades — associated with death, paganism, and the underworld — and declaring that his church would not be defeated by it. The imagery was not abstract to the people standing there. They could see it.

The statement also reinforces what was said in the teaching about what Jesus is building the church *on*: not Peter as a person, but the confession Peter just made — the recognition of who Jesus truly is. That recognition, spoken at that location, carries significant dramatic weight.

## The Road to Emmaus as an Interpretive Method

The Emmaus road account in Luke 24 is more than a post-resurrection appearance story. It is a statement about **how Scripture is meant to be read.**

When Jesus opens the scriptures "beginning with Moses and all the Prophets" and explains "what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself," he is demonstrating what biblical scholars call a **Christocentric hermeneutic** — reading the whole of Scripture with Christ as its organizing center and destination.

This was not a new idea invented after the resurrection. Jesus had already stated it directly during his ministry: *"You study the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify about me."* (John 5:39)

What changed after the resurrection was the disciples' capacity to receive it. With the reality of the risen Jesus in front of them, everything Moses wrote, everything the prophets said, and everything in the Psalms suddenly read differently. The Emmaus encounter is Luke's way of showing that the resurrection didn't just validate Jesus' identity — it unlocked the entire biblical narrative.

This is the interpretive lens this study is committed to using: not asking what a passage says in isolation, but tracing what it says *concerning Jesus* — and following that thread from Genesis all the way to Revelation.
