# Welcome

This is a structured study of the book of Revelation — approached not as a standalone prophecy manual, but as the final chapter of a story that begins in Genesis. The goal is to read Revelation the way Jesus read Scripture on the road to Emmaus: starting with Moses, tracing the thread through the Prophets and the Psalms, and following it all the way to the end.

Each session builds on the last. The material is organized to be accessible to someone with no theological background, while remaining substantive enough to reward deeper study. Nothing here requires prior knowledge — only a willingness to let the text speak for itself.

These notes are compiled from a weekly study group and are intended as a reference resource, not a replacement for personal engagement with Scripture.

## How to Use This Site

Each chapter includes three companion documents: the main teaching notes, a record of questions raised during the session, and supplemental historical and scholarly context. A running [[Glossary]] serves as the single reference point for key terms across the entire study.
