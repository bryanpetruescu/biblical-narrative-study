## Biblical Worldview

A comprehensive framework for understanding reality — including suffering, evil, history, and human purpose — grounded in the full narrative of Scripture rather than in cultural assumptions, selective teaching, or personal experience alone.

A biblical worldview is not simply knowing Bible facts. It is having a God-anchored framework robust enough to interpret current events, personal suffering, and the claims of others without being dependent on outside voices for orientation. The teacher in this study identifies it as the single best defense against fear-mongering and spiritual manipulation.

## Caesarea Philippi

A city in the far north of ancient Israel, near the base of Mount Hermon, and the location of Peter's confession of Christ in Matthew 16. In the first century, Caesarea Philippi was a prominent center of pagan worship associated with the Greek god Pan. At the base of a large rock cliff there was a cave and spring that the Greeks called the **Gates of Hades** — believed to be a literal entrance to the underworld. The surrounding area contained multiple temples, including a shrine to the Roman emperor Augustus.

Jesus chose this location to ask *"Who do you say I am?"*, receive Peter's confession, and declare *"the gates of Hades will not overcome"* his church — a statement whose imagery would have been vivid and immediate to those standing in front of that cliff.

## Extra-Biblical Literature

Texts produced within Jewish or early Christian communities that are not part of the canonical 66 books of the Bible, but provide valuable cultural, theological, and literary context for reading it. Examples include writings found among the Dead Sea Scrolls and various documents from the Second Temple Period.

These texts do not carry scriptural authority. Their value is contextual — they help modern readers recover the shared knowledge and assumptions that first-century Jewish audiences would have brought to the biblical text automatically. Engaging them is not about expanding the canon; it is about reading Scripture in the world it was written into.

## Joy

In the biblical sense, joy is distinct from happiness. Where happiness is circumstantial — rising and falling with external conditions — joy is a cultivated orientation rooted in the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit and the certainty of God's promises. It is not dependent on circumstances and cannot be taken by them.

Paul describes this in Philippians 4:11: *"I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances"* — written from prison. Joy, in this framework, is not a feeling that happens to you. It is a settled state that forms in you through relationship with God, particularly through difficulty.

## Messiah

Hebrew for "anointed one" (Greek: *Christos*, from which we get "Christ"). The figure prophesied throughout the Old Testament who would come to redeem Israel and establish God's eternal kingdom.

In the first century, dominant Jewish expectation of the Messiah centered on a political and military deliverer — one who would overthrow Rome, restore the Davidic throne in Jerusalem, and vindicate Israel as a nation. This expectation, while rooted in genuine Old Testament prophecy, was partial and selective. It emphasized the texts about a conquering king while underweighting the texts describing a suffering servant (most notably Isaiah 52–53). The disciples shared this expectation, which is the primary reason they were unable to process Jesus' repeated predictions of his own death — and why the resurrection came as a complete shock rather than a confirmation of what they'd been told.

## Pentateuch

The first five books of the Bible: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. Traditionally attributed to Moses and frequently referred to in the New Testament as "the Law of Moses" or simply "Moses." When Jesus says in Luke 24 that he explained *"beginning with Moses"* what the Scriptures said about him, he is starting with these five books. The Pentateuch establishes the foundational narrative, covenants, and imagery that the rest of Scripture builds on and that Revelation ultimately resolves.

## Prosperity Gospel

A theological position — also called "health, wealth, and prosperity" theology — claiming that Christian faith guarantees material blessing in this life. The core promise is that faithful Christians will be rewarded with physical health, financial prosperity, and general success as a direct result of their belief and generosity.

The teacher identifies this as fundamentally incompatible with the Gospel Jesus presented, for two reasons. Logically, it sets believers up for a crisis of faith when suffering inevitably comes — forcing them to conclude either that God failed or that their own faith is insufficient. Textually, it contradicts Jesus' explicit teaching on suffering, discipleship, and the nature of the kingdom, as well as his warnings about false prophets who promise thorns and thistles (the curse) while calling it fruit (Matthew 7:15–16; Matthew 13:22).

## Revelation

The final book of the Christian canon, and the destination of this study. A prophetic vision given to the Apostle John — traditionally identified as the Apostle and author of the Gospel of John — concerning the culmination of God's redemptive plan and the end of history as we know it.

Revelation is written in a genre called *apocalyptic literature*, which uses vivid symbolic imagery to communicate spiritual and cosmic realities. Its symbols and figures are almost entirely drawn from earlier Old Testament texts — particularly Daniel, Ezekiel, Isaiah, and Zechariah. This means Revelation cannot be read in isolation; it is the final chapter of a story that must be understood from the beginning to be read correctly.

## Second Temple Period

The era of Jewish history roughly spanning 516 BC to 70 AD, bookended by the rebuilding of the Jerusalem Temple after the Babylonian exile and its destruction by Rome. The entire New Testament was written within this period, and the cultural, theological, and literary world it describes is rooted here.

Much of the extra-biblical literature referenced in this study originates from this period. The religious traditions, messianic expectations, and interpretive frameworks that shaped the disciples — and that Jesus was constantly engaging and correcting — were formed during these centuries.

## Son of Man

A title Jesus applied to himself frequently throughout the Gospels. It carries two distinct layers of meaning in the Jewish world Jesus was speaking into.

The first is the straightforward Hebrew idiom *ben adam* — "son of man" — simply meaning "human being," used throughout Ezekiel to address the prophet and emphasize his creaturely nature.

The second, and far more significant, usage comes from Daniel 7:13–14, where a figure described as "one like a son of man" approaches the Ancient of Days (God) on clouds of heaven and is given eternal, universal dominion over all nations. This is not a humble figure — it is a cosmic ruler receiving the kingdom of God.

When Jesus called himself the Son of Man, he was drawing on both layers simultaneously: fully human, and yet carrying the identity of Daniel's universal, eternal king. The full theological significance of this title will be explored in a later session.
